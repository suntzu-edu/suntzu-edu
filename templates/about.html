        <h5> <i class="fas fa-rocket text-info"></i> Operation</h5>
        <p class="ms-5">Suntzu Academy runs independently. There's no instructors, no management teams, no weapons, no funds, no graduates at this moment; Of course, there's no tuitions either. 大樹 is in charge of the operation.</p>
