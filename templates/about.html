        <h5> <i class="fas fa-align-justify"></i> Core Values</h5>
        <p class="ms-5">
        We understand that we won't achieve our goal unless the majority Chinese people are with us. Therefore, we are going to facilitate the coming of the Age of Enlightenment for Chinese people like the one in Europe in the 18th century. <br> <br>
        Here's a brief description of the Age of Enlightenment in Europe: <br>
        The Enlightenment was a philosophical movement that dominated in Europe during the 18th century. It was centered around the idea that <em>reason</em> is the primary source of authority and legitimacy, and it advocated such ideals as liberty, progress, tolerance, fraternity, constitutional government, and separation of church and state. 
        <br> <br>
        The ultimate goal of the enlightenment is that the majority of Chinese people embraces the Laws of Nature mentioned in <em>The Declaration of Independence</em> that 'All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. -- That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, -- That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.' 

        <br><br>
        Suntzu Academy put faith and love at the top of our list; We love God, love our ancestors, and love traditional Chinese cultures. With that in mind, we practice military skills and learn military knowledge and technology.</p>
