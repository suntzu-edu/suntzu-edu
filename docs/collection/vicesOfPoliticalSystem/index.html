                        This evil has been so fully experienced both during the war and since the peace, results so naturally from the number and independent authority of the States and has been so uniformly <span class='word'>examplified</span> in every similar Confederacy, that it may be considered as not less radically and permanently inherent in, than it is fatal to the object of, the present System.

                    <div>
                        Examples of this are numerous and repetitions may be foreseen in almost every case where any favorite object of a State shall present a temptation. Among these examples are the wars and Treaties of Georgia with the Indians—The unlicensed compacts between Virginia and Maryland, and between Pennsylvania and New Jersey—the troops raised and to be kept up by Massachusetts.

                            From the number of Legislatures, the sphere of life from which most of their members are taken, and the circumstances under which their legislative business is <span class='word'>carried on</span>, irregularities of this kind must frequently happen. Accordingly not a year has passed without instances of them in some one or other of the States. The Treaty of peace—the treaty with France—the treaty with Holland have each been violated. The causes of these irregularities must necessarily produce frequent violations of the law of nations in other respects.

                            These are alarming symptoms, and may be daily apprehended as we are <span class='word'>admonished</span> by daily experience. See the law of Virginia restricting foreign vessels to certain ports—of Maryland in favor of vessels belonging to her own citizens—of N. York in favor of the same.

                            Paper money, <span class='word'>installments</span> of debts, <span class='word'>occlusion</span> of Courts, making property a <span class='word'>legal tender</span>, may likewise be deemed aggressions on the rights of other States. As the Citizens of every State aggregately taken stand more or less in the relation of Creditors or debtors, to the Citizens of every other States, Acts of the debtor State in favor of debtors, affect the Creditor State, in the same manner, as they do its own citizens who are relatively creditors towards other citizens. This remark may be extended to foreign nations. If the exclusive regulation of the value and alloy of coin was properly delegated to the federal authority, the policy of it equally requires a control on the States in the cases above mentioned. It must have been meant 1. to preserve uniformity in the circulating <span class='word'>medium</span> throughout the nation. 2. to prevent those frauds on the citizens of other States, and the subjects of foreign powers, which might disturb the tranquility at home, or involve the Union in foreign contests.

                            The practice of many States in restricting the commercial intercourse with other States, and putting their productions and manufactures <span class='word'>on the same footing with</span> those of foreign nations, though not contrary to the federal articles, is certainly adverse to the spirit of the Union, and tends to <span class='word'>beget</span> retaliating regulations, not less expensive and <span class='word'>vexatious</span> in themselves, than they are destructive of the general harmony.

                        This defect is strongly illustrated in the state of our commercial affairs. How much has the national dignity, interest, and revenue suffered from this cause? Instances of inferior moment are the want of uniformity in the laws concerning naturalization and literary property; of <span class='word'>provision</span> for national <span class='word'>seminaries</span>, for <span class='word'>grants</span> of <span class='word'>incorporation</span> for national purposes, for <span class='word'>canals</span> and other works of general utility, which may at present be defeated by the perverseness of particular States whose <span class='word'>concurrence</span> is necessary.

                    <div>
                        The confederation is silent on this point and therefore by the second article the hands of the federal authority are tied. According to Republican Theory, Right and power being both <span class='word'>vested</span> in the majority, are held to be synonymous. According to fact and experience a minority may in an <span class='word'>appeal</span> to force, be an <span class='word'>overmatch</span> for the majority. 1. If the minority happen to include all such as possess the skill and habits of military life, & such as possess the great <span class='word'>pecuniary</span> resources, one third only may conquer the remaining two thirds. 2. One third of those who participate in the choice of the rulers, may be rendered a majority by the <span class='word'>accession</span> of those whose poverty excludes them from a right of <span class='word'>suffrage</span>, and who for obvious reasons will be more likely to join the standard of <span class='word'>sedition</span> than that of the established Government. 3. Where slavery exists the republican Theory becomes still more <span class='word'>fallacious</span>.

                    <h6>
                        7. want of <span class='word'>sanction</span> to the laws, and of coercion in the Government of the Confederacy.
                    </h6>

                    <div>
                        A sanction is essential to the <span class='word'>idea</span> of law, as coercion is to that of Government. The federal system being <span class='word'>destitute</span> of both, wants the great vital principles of a Political Constitution. Under the form of such a Constitution, it is in fact nothing more than a treaty of <span class='word'>amity</span> of commerce and of alliance, between so many independent and Sovereign States. From what <span class='word'>cause</span> could so fatal an omission have happened in the articles of Confederation? from a mistaken confidence that the justice, the good faith, the honor, the sound policy, of the several legislative assemblies would render <span class='word'>superfluous</span> any appeal to the ordinary motives by which the laws secure the obedience of individuals: a confidence which <span class='word'>does honor to</span> the enthusiastic virtue of the compilers, as much as the inexperience of the crisis apologizes for their errors. The time which has since elapsed has had the double effect, of increasing the light and <span class='word'>tempering</span> the warmth, with which the <span class='word'>arduous</span> work may be revised. It is no longer doubted that a unanimous and <span class='word'>punctual</span> obedience of 13 independent bodies, to the acts of the federal Government, ought not be <span class='word'>calculated on</span>. Even during the war, when external danger supplied in some degree the defect of legal & coercive sanctions, how imperfectly did the States fulfil their obligations to the Union? In time of peace, we see already what is to be expected. How indeed could it be otherwise? In the first place, Every general act of the Union must necessarily bear unequally hard on some particular member or members of it. Secondly the partiality of the members to their own interests and rights, a partiality which will be <span class='word'>fostered</span> by the <span class='word'>Courtiers</span> of popularity, will naturally exaggerate the inequality where it exists, and even suspect it where it has no existence. Thirdly a distrust of the voluntary compliance of each other may prevent the compliance of any, although it should be the <span class='word'>latent</span> disposition of all. Here are causes and pretexts which will never fail to render federal measures <span class='word'>abortive</span>. If the laws of the States, were merely recommendatory to their citizens, or if they were to be rejudged by County authorities, what security, what probability would exist, that they would be carried into execution? Is the security or probability greater in favor of the acts of Congress which depending for their execution on the will of the state legislatures, which are though nominally authoritative, in fact recommendatory only.
                    </div>
                </div>


                <div>
                    <h6>
                        8. Want of <span class='word'>ratification</span> by the people of the articles of Confederation.
                    </h6>

                    <div>
                        In some of the States the Confederation is recognized by, and forms a part of the constitution. In others however it has received no other sanction than that of the Legislative authority. From this defect two evils result: 1. Whenever a law of a State happens to be <span class='word'>repugnant</span> to an act of Congress, particularly when the latter is of <span class='word'>posterior</span> date to the former, it will be at least questionable whether the latter must not prevail; and as the question must be decided by the <span class='word'>Tribunals</span> of the State, they will be most likely to lean on the side of the State.
                        2. As far as the Union of the States is to be regarded as a league of sovereign powers, and not as a political Constitution by virtue of which they are become one sovereign power, so far it seems to follow from the doctrine of compacts, that a breach of any of the articles of the confederation by any of the parties to it, <span class='word'>absolves</span> the other parties from their respective obligations, and gives them a right if they choose to exert it, of <span class='word'>dissolving</span> the Union altogether.

                    <h6>
                    9. Multiplicity of laws in the several States.
                    </h6>

                    <div>
                        In developing the evils which vitiate the political system of the United States. it is proper to include those which are found within the States individually, as well as those which directly affect the States collectively, since the former class have an indirect influence on the general <span class='word'>malady</span> and must not be overlooked in forming a complete remedy. Among the evils then of our situation may well be ranked the multiplicity of laws from which no State is exempt. As far as laws are necessary, to mark with precision the duties of those who are to obey them, and to take from those who are to <span class='word'>administer</span> them a <span class='word'>discretion</span>, which might be abused, their number is the price of liberty. As far as the laws exceed this limit, they are a <span class='word'>nuisance</span>: a nuisance of the most <span class='word'>pestilent</span> kind. Try the Codes of the several States by this test, and what a luxuriancy of legislation do they present. The short period of independency has filled as many pages as the century which preceded it. Every year, almost every session, adds a new volume. This may be the effect in part, but it can only be in part, of the situation in which the revolution has placed us. A review of the several codes will show that every necessary and useful part of the least <span class='word'>voluminous</span> of them might be compressed into one tenth of the compass, and at the same time be rendered tenfold as <span class='word'>perspicuous</span>.
                    </div>
                </div>

                    10. mutability of the laws of the States.
                    </h6>

                    <div>
                        This evil is intimately connected with the former yet deserves a distinct notice as it <span class='word'>emphatically</span> denotes a vicious legislation. We daily see laws <span class='word'>repealed</span> or superseded, before any trial can have been made of their merits; and even before a knowledge of them can have reached the remoter districts within which they were to operate. In the regulations of trade this instability becomes a snare not only to our citizens but to foreigners also.

                        <div>
                            If the multiplicity and mutability of laws prove a want of wisdom, their injustice <span class='word'>betrays</span> a defect still more alarming: more alarming not merely because it is a greater evil in itself, but because it brings more into question the fundamental principle of republican Government, that the majority who rule in such Governments, are the safest Guardians both of public Good and of private rights. To what causes is this evil to be <span class='word'>ascribed</span>? These causes lie	1. in the Representative bodies. 2. in the people themselves. 
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            1. Representative appointments are sought from 3 <span class='word'>motives</span>. 1. ambition, 2. personal interest, 3. public good. Unhappily the two first are proved by experience to be most prevalent. Hence the candidates who feel them, particularly, the second, are most <span class='word'>industrious</span>, and most successful in pursuing their object: and forming often a majority in the legislative Councils, with <span class='word'>interested</span> views, contrary to the interest, and views, of their Constituents, join in a <span class='word'>perfidious</span> sacrifice of the latter to the former. A succeeding election it might be <span class='word'>supposed</span>, would displace the offenders, and repair the <span class='word'>mischief</span>. But how easily are <span class='word'>base</span> and selfish measures, masked by <span class='word'>pretexts</span> of public good and apparent <span class='word'>expediency</span>? How frequently will a repetition of the same arts and industry which succeeded <span class='word'>in the first instance</span>, again <span class='word'>prevail</span> on the unwary to <span class='word'>misplace</span> their confidence?
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            How frequently too will the honest but unenlightened representative be the <span class='word'>dupe</span> of a favorite leader, veiling his selfish views under the professions of public good, and <span class='word'>varnishing</span> his <span class='word2'>sophistical</span> arguments with the glowing colours of popular eloquence? 
                        </div>
     
                        <div>
                            2. A still more fatal if not more frequent cause lies among the people themselves. All civilized societies are divided into different interests and <span class='word'>factions</span>, as they happen to be creditors or debtors—Rich or poor—<span class='word'>husbandmen</span>, merchants or manufacturers—members of different religious sects—followers of different political leaders—inhabitants of different districts—owners of different kinds of property, etc., etc. In republican Government the majority however composed, ultimately give the law. Whenever therefore an apparent interest or common passion unites a majority what is to restrain them from unjust violations of the rights and interests of the minority, or of individuals?

This consideration although of decisive weight in itself, is found by experience to be too often <span class='word'>unheeded</span>. It is too often forgotten, by nations as well as by individuals that honesty is the best policy.

                            Secondly. <span class='word'>respect</span> for <span class='word'>character</span>. However strong this motive may be in individuals, it is considered as very insufficient to <span class='word'>restrain</span> them from injustice. In a multitude its <span class='word'>efficacy</span> is diminished in proportion to the number which is to share the praise or the blame. Besides, as it has reference to public opinion, which within a particular Society, is the opinion of the majority, the standard is fixed by those whose conduct is to be measured by it. The public opinion without the Society, will be little respected by the people <span class='word'>at large</span> of any Country. Individuals of extended views, and of national pride, may bring the <span class='word'>public proceedings</span> to this standard, but the example will never be followed by the multitude. Is it to be imagined that an ordinary citizen or even an assemblyman of Rhode Island in estimating the policy of paper money, ever considered or cared in what light the measure would be viewed in France or Holland; or even in Massachusetts or Connecticut? It was a sufficient <span class='word'>temptation</span> to both that it was for their interest: it was a sufficient <span class='word'>sanction</span> to the latter that it was popular in the State; to the former that it was so in the neighbourhood.

                                       The author here states that one of the motives that drives congressmen to make sound decisions is their due regard for a moral standard with good reputation. In that sense this moral standard has reference to public opinion, because reputation comes from the public. However, once the public opinion as the anchor is replaced by the opinion of the majority in the Congress, there will be two effects: firstly, the respect for character now only has business to do with the small group of Congressmen instead of the whole society. Certainly the majority of the Congressmen will still be measured by a certain standard, however, they are able to set up that stardard at their disposition. Secondly, once public opinion loses grip on Congress, then almost no Congressmen cares about it any longer.

                            Thirdly. will Religion the only remaining motive be a sufficient restraint? It is not pretended to be such on men individually considered. Will its effect be greater on them considered in an aggregate view? quite the reverse. The conduct of every popular assembly acting on oath, the strongest of religious Ties, proves that individuals join without remorse in acts, against which their consciences would revolt if proposed to them under the like <span class='word'>sanction</span>, separately in their closets. When indeed Religion is kindled into enthusiasm, its force like that of other passions, is increased by the <span class='word'>sympathy</span> of a multitude. But enthusiasm is only a temporary state of religion, and while it lasts will hardly be seen with pleasure <span class='word'>at the helm of</span> Government. Besides as religion in its coolest state, is not infallible, it may become a motive to oppression as well as a restraint from injustice. Place three individuals in a situation wherein the interest of each depends on the voice of the others, and give to two of them an interest opposed to the rights of the third? Will the latter be secure? The prudence of every man would shun the danger. The rules and forms of justice suppose and guard against it. Will two thousand in a like situation be less likely to encroach on the rights of one thousand? The contrary is witnessed by the notorious factions and oppressions which take place in corporate towns limited as the opportunities are, and in little republics when uncontrolled by apprehensions of external danger. If an enlargement of the sphere is found to lessen the insecurity of private rights, it is not because the impulse of a common interest or passion is less predominant in this case with the majority; but because a common interest or passion is less apt to be felt and the requisite combinations less easy to be formed by a great than by a small number. The Society becomes broken into a greater variety of interests, of pursuits, of passions, which check each other, whilst those who may feel a common sentiment have less opportunity of communication and concert. It may be inferred that the inconveniences of popular States contrary to the prevailing Theory, are in proportion not to the extent, but to the narrowness of their limits.

                            The great <span class='word'>desideratum</span> in Government is such a modification of the Sovereignty as will render it sufficiently neutral between the different interests and factions, to control one part of the Society from invading the rights of another, and at the same time sufficiently controlled itself, from setting up an interest adverse to that of the whole Society. In absolute Monarchies, the prince is sufficiently, neutral towards his subjects, but frequently sacrifices their happiness to his ambition or his <span class='word'>avarice</span>. In small Republics, the sovereign will is sufficiently controlled from such a Sacrifice of the entire Society, but is not sufficiently neutral towards the parts composing it. As a limited Monarchy tempers the evils of an absolute one; so an extensive Republic <span class='word'>meliorates</span> the administration of a small Republic.

                            An auxiliary desideratum for the melioration of the Republican form is such a process of elections as will most certainly extract from the mass of the Society the purest and noblest characters which it contains; such as will at once feel most strongly the proper motives to pursue the end of their appointment, and be most capable to devise the proper means of attaining it.
