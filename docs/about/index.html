                <p>
                Since the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) usurped the governing power in China in 1949, it has committed uncountable crimes in China. In 2019, unfortunately it unleashed COVID-19 virus from Wuhan Institute of Virology to the world and led to hundreds of millions of infections and millions of people death around the globe as of February 2022. </p>
                <p>According to 'The Declaration of Independence' and modern democratic common sense, such a government has totally lost its legitimacy. Therefore, we the Chinese people, has the obligation to abolish it and holds all of its key members accountable for their crimes domestic and international. </p>
                <p>Suntzu Academy is established to take the mission of overthrowing the Chinese Communist Party and reconstructing a modern republic of China for Chinese people.

        <p class="ms-5">
        We understand that we won't achieve our goal unless the majority Chinese people are with us. Therefore, we are going to facilitate the coming of the Age of Enlightenment for Chinese people like the one in Europe in the 18th century. <br> <br>
        Here's a brief description of the Age of Enlightenment in Europe: <br>
        The Enlightenment was a philosophical movement that dominated in Europe during the 18th century. It was centered around the idea that <em>reason</em> is the primary source of authority and legitimacy, and it advocated such ideals as liberty, progress, tolerance, fraternity, constitutional government, and separation of church and state. 
        <br> <br>
        The ultimate goal of the enlightenment is that the majority of Chinese people embraces the Laws of Nature mentioned in <em>The Declaration of Independence</em> that 'All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. -- That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, -- That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.' 

        <br><br>
        Suntzu Academy put faith and love at the top of our list; We love God, love our ancestors, and love traditional Chinese cultures. With that in mind, we practice military skills and learn military knowledge and technology.</p>


        <h5> <i class="fas fa-align-justify"></i> &nbsp  Operation</h5>
        <p class="ms-5">Suntzu Academy runs independently. There's no instructors, no management teams, no weapons, no funds, no graduates at this moment; Of course, there's no tuitions either. 大樹 is in charge of the operation.</p>
