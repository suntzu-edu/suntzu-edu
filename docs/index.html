            There is a belief crisis going on among Chinese people. On the one hand, most of Chinese people have lost or given up Chinese traditional cultures; on the other hand, they refuse to adopt new beliefs, especially Christianity. 
            </p>
            </p>
            While we Chinese people are lucky to have numerous great ancestors and their words as our spiritual heritage throughout the history, more and more people are ignorant of them nowadays. Worse than that, people usually tend to have negative opinions about our ancestors and their words even though most of them acknowledge that they have read little of our ancestor's words. This is something called cultural collapse which only leads to the disintegration of Chinese nation in the end.
            </p>

            <p>It's urgent to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ into mainland China as well. In the history, there're multiple Christian missionaries coming to China to preach the gospel, such as James Hudson Taylor who founded China Inland Mission. However, the political situation after 1949 in mainland China made the preaching almost impossible. Most of Christian missionaries like China Inland Mission had to leave permanently. We've seen how Christianity gracefully works in believer's personal lives and throughtout civil societies and we don't want mainland China become abandoned by God.</p>

            <p>
                There're so much to do in regards to belief construction, enlightenment, and gospel preach in mainland China.
                We are to be lit, day and night, until our nation wakes up.

                <img src="static/sun100.jpg" class="img-fluid float-start me-5"> <p>Sun Tzu was a Chinese general, military strategist, writer, and philosopher who lived in the Eastern Zhou period of ancient China. Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of The Art of War. His works focus much more on alternatives to battle, such as stratagem, delay, the use of spies and alternatives to war itself, the making and keeping of alliances, the uses of deceit, and a willingness to submit, at least temporarily, to more powerful foes.</p>
