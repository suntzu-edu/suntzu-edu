            While we Chinese people are lucky to have numerous great ancestors and their words as our spiritual heritage throughout the history, more and more people are ignorant of them nowadays. Worse than that, people usually tend to have negative opinions about our ancestors and their words even though most of them acknowledge that they have read little of our ancestor's words. We are deeply concerned about this cultural collapse and the disintegration of our Chinese nation. As for the world, if modern Chinese don't know their culture any more, it will also be a huge loss to all. Therefore, we are dedicated to rescuing our cultural heritage, especially Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism.

            We are to be lit, day and night, until our nation wakes up.

                <img src="static/sun100.jpg" class="img-fluid float-start me-5"> <p>Sun Tzu was a Chinese general, military strategist, writer, and philosopher who lived in the Eastern Zhou period of ancient China. Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of The Art of War. His works focus much more on alternatives to battle, such as stratagem, delay, the use of spies and alternatives to war itself, the making and keeping of alliances, the uses of deceit, and a willingness to submit, at least temporarily, to more powerful foes.</p>

                <p>The Art of War (Chinese: 孫子兵法) is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Late Spring and Autumn Period (roughly 5th century BC). </p>
