                    </div>

                    <div class='green-1 indent-1em f-size-0_9em notes-ethics'>所有人類有意識的活動－－投入技巧與想像的生產製作、對事實與原理的研究、製作成品、為達到目的而付出的探索，眾所周知，皆指向某些美好。</div>

                    <div>
                        2. and for this reason the good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim. 
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        3. some are activities, others are products apart from the activities that produce them.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        4. Where there are ends apart from the actions, it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities. 
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        5. Now, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends also are many; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel, that of strategy victory, that of economics wealth.
                    </div>

                    <div class='green-1 indent-1em f-size-0_9em notes-ethics  '>人類的活動五花八門，其目的各有不同，相對應的美好也不同。</div>


                    <div>
                        6. But where such arts fall under a single <span class='word'>capacity</span>- as bridle-making and the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this and every military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall under yet others.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        7. in all of these the ends of the master arts are to be preferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is for the sake of the former that the latter are pursued.
                    </div>

                    <div class='green-1 indent-1em f-size-0_9em notes-ethics    '>若活動乙的完成是為了活動甲，那活動甲比活動乙高級。</div>
        
                    <div>
                        8. It makes no difference whether the activities themselves are the ends of the actions, or something else apart from the activities, as in the case of the sciences just mentioned.

                        1. If, then, there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for its own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this), and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good and the <span class='word'>chief</span> good. 
                    </div>


                    <div class='green-1 indent-1em f-size-0_9em notes-ethics   '>人類活動所對應的美好中，必定有最高級的美好。</div>

                        2. Will not the knowledge of it, then, have a great influence on life? Shall we not, like archers who have a mark to aim at, be more likely to hit upon what is right?

                    <div>
                        3. If so, we must try, in outline at least, to determine what it is, and of which of the sciences or capacities it is the object.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        4. It would seem to belong to the most authoritative art and that which is most truly the master art. And politics appears to be of this nature;
                    </div>


                    <div class='green-1 indent-1em f-size-0_9em notes-ethics   '>人類活動所追求的最高級的美好，應該對應於最高級的人類活動－－政治。</div>


                    <div>
                        5. for it is this that <span class='word'>ordains</span> which of the sciences should be studied in a state, and which each class of citizens should learn and up to what point they should learn them; and we see even the most highly esteemed of <span class='word'>capacities</span> to fall under this, e.g. strategy, economics, rhetoric; 
                    </div>


                    <div class='green-1 indent-1em f-size-0_9em notes-ethics   '>被人們普遍尊重的學科與職業－－戰爭學、經濟學、演講能力，都在政治學範疇之下。</div>



                    <div>
                        6. now, since politics uses the rest of the sciences, and since, again, it legislates as to what we are to do and what we are to abstain from, the end of this science must include those of the others, so that this end must be the good for man.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        7. For even if the end is the same for a single man and for a state, that of the state seems <span class='word'>at all events</span> something greater and more complete whether to attain or to preserve; though it is worth while to attain the end merely for one man, it is finer and more godlike to attain it for a nation or for city-states. These, then, are the ends at which our inquiry aims, since it is political science, in one sense of that term.

                    <div>
                        Our discussion will be adequate if it has as much clearness as the subject-matter <span class='word'>admits of</span>, for precision is not to be sought for alike in all discussions, any more than in all the products of the crafts. Now fine and just actions, which political science investigates, admit of much variety and fluctuation of opinion, so that they may be thought to exist only by <span class='word'>convention</span>, and not by <span class='word'>nature</span>. And goods also give rise to a similar fluctuation because they bring harm to many people; for before now men have been <span class='word'>undone</span> by reason of their wealth, and others by reason of their courage. We must be content, then, in speaking of such subjects and with such premisses to indicate the truth roughly and in outline, and in speaking about things which are only for the most part true and with premisses of the same kind to reach conclusions that are no better. In the same spirit, therefore, should each type of statement be received; for it is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in each class of things just so far as the nature of the subject admits; it is evidently equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician and to demand from a rhetorician scientific proofs.

                    </div>

                    <div>
                        Now each man judges well the things he knows, and of these he is a good judge. And so the man who has been educated in a subject is a good judge of that subject, and the man who has received an all-round education is a good judge in general. Hence a young man is not a proper hearer of lectures on political science; for he is inexperienced in the actions that occur in life, but its discussions start from these and are about these; and, further, since he tends to follow his passions, his study will be vain and unprofitable, because the end aimed at is not knowledge but action. And it makes no difference whether he is young in years or youthful in character; the defect does not depend on time, but on his living, and pursuing each successive object, as passion directs. For to such persons, as to the <span class='word'>incontinent</span>, knowledge brings no profit; but to those who desire and act in accordance with a rational principle knowledge about such matters will be of great benefit.
